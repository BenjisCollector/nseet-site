  <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: February 24, 2026</p>

  <p>These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your use of Nseet ("the App"), a days counter and tracker for iOS developed by Yousef Qasim. By downloading or using the App, you agree to these Terms.</p>

  <h2>Use of the App</h2>
  <p>Nseet is provided for personal, non-commercial use. You may create events, countdowns, and use widgets as intended by the App. You agree not to misuse the App or attempt to access it through unauthorized means.</p>

  <h2>Subscriptions and Purchases</h2>
  <p>Nseet offers the following optional in-app purchases to unlock premium features ("Nseet Pro"):</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Monthly subscription</strong> — auto-renews each month at the listed price.</li>
    <li><strong>Yearly subscription</strong> — auto-renews each year at the listed price.</li>
    <li><strong>Lifetime purchase</strong> — a one-time payment for permanent access.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Subscription prices are displayed in the App before purchase and may vary by region. Payment is charged to your Apple ID account at confirmation of purchase.</p>

  <h2>Auto-Renewal</h2>
  <p>Monthly and yearly subscriptions automatically renew unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period at the same price.</p>

  <h2>Managing Subscriptions</h2>
  <p>You can manage or cancel your subscriptions at any time through your Apple ID account settings or the App Store. Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period.</p>

  <h2>Refunds</h2>
  <p>All purchases are processed by Apple. To request a refund, visit <a href="https://reportaproblem.apple.com">reportaproblem.apple.com</a> or contact Apple Support.</p>

  <h2>Free Trial</h2>
  <p>If a free trial is offered, it will be clearly stated before purchase. If you do not cancel before the trial ends, your subscription will automatically begin and you will be charged.</p>

  <h2>Content and Data</h2>
  <p>All content you create in Nseet (events, countdowns, photos) is stored locally on your device. We do not access, collect, or store your data. You are responsible for maintaining backups of your device.</p>

  <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>The App, including its design, code, graphics, and cat mascot, is owned by Yousef Qasim. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or reverse-engineer any part of the App.</p>

  <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>Nseet is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. We do not guarantee that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or meet your specific requirements.</p>

  <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the App.</p>

  <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
  <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about these Terms, contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@nseet.app">hello@nseet.app</a>.</p>
