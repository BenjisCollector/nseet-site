  <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: February 24, 2026</p>

  <p>These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your use of the Nseet mobile application ("the App") developed by Yousef Qasem ("we", "us", or "our"). By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to these Terms.</p>

  <h2>Use of the App</h2>
  <p>Nseet is a days counter and event tracker for iOS. You may use the App for personal, non-commercial purposes. You agree not to misuse the App, reverse-engineer it, or use it in any way that violates applicable laws.</p>

  <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
  <p>Nseet offers optional premium features through in-app purchases:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Nseet Pro Lifetime</strong> — a one-time purchase that unlocks all premium features permanently.</li>
    <li><strong>Nseet Pro Monthly</strong> — an auto-renewable subscription billed monthly.</li>
    <li><strong>Nseet Pro Yearly</strong> — an auto-renewable subscription billed annually.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
  <p>Auto-renewable subscriptions are billed at the start of each subscription period (monthly or yearly). Payment is charged to your Apple ID account at confirmation of purchase.</p>
  <p>Your subscription automatically renews unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period at the same price.</p>
  <p>You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your Account Settings in the App Store after purchase. Any unused portion of a free trial period will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription.</p>

  <h2>Refunds</h2>
  <p>All purchases are processed by Apple. To request a refund, please visit <a href="https://reportaproblem.apple.com">reportaproblem.apple.com</a> or contact Apple Support directly.</p>

  <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>The App is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. We do not guarantee that the App will be error-free or uninterrupted. We are not liable for any damages arising from your use of the App.</p>

  <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from your use of the App.</p>

  <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
  <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms. We will update the date at the top of this page when changes are made.</p>

  <h2>Governing Law</h2>
  <p>These Terms are governed by the laws applicable in the jurisdiction where the developer resides, without regard to conflict of law provisions.</p>
